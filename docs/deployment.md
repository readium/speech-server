# Deployment

Automated: CI passes on `main` → `deploy.yml` builds + pushes the image to GHCR and
SSHes into the GCP VM to pull + restart. **Config (`.env`, `pocket-tts.env`) is
provisioned by the pipeline from GitHub Secrets — you never edit it on the VM by
hand, and you never run the wizard in production.** `configure.sh` is a *local /
first-time* convenience only.

## How config flows

```
local .env / pocket-tts.env  ──base64──▶  GitHub Secrets  ──deploy.yml writes──▶  VM files  ──▶  containers
```

`.env` and `pocket-tts.env` are gitignored (they hold secrets). The two GitHub
secrets `DOTENV_B64` / `POCKET_TTS_ENV_B64` are the single source of truth; the
deploy job decodes them onto the VM before `docker compose up`.

## One-time setup

### 1. Local — produce the env files
Generate them however you like (the wizard is easiest):
```bash
./scripts/configure.sh     # or hand-edit .env and pocket-tts.env
```
Then base64-encode each (copy the output):
```bash
base64 -i .env | pbcopy            # macOS; or:  base64 -w0 .env   (Linux)
base64 -i pocket-tts.env | pbcopy
```

### 2. GitHub — create the secrets
Repo → **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret**:

| Secret | Value |
|---|---|
| `DOTENV_B64` | base64 of your `.env` |
| `POCKET_TTS_ENV_B64` | base64 of your `pocket-tts.env` |
| `GCP_VM_HOST` / `GCP_VM_USER` / `GCP_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY` | VM SSH access (already set) |

### 3. VM — prepare once (no config edits)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/readium/speech-server ~/speech-server
# install docker + docker compose plugin
# if the GHCR image is private, authenticate so `docker compose pull` works:
echo "$GHCR_PAT" | docker login ghcr.io -u <user> --password-stdin
```
The `weights_cache` Docker volume persists across deploys, so models download only
once. Nginx serves TLS (see `nginx/` + `DOMAIN`).

## Changing config (any env var, add or edit) — the whole point

**No SSH, no wizard on the VM.** Update the source and redeploy:

1. Edit `.env` / `pocket-tts.env` locally (or re-run the wizard).
2. Re-base64 and update the corresponding GitHub secret (`DOTENV_B64` /
   `POCKET_TTS_ENV_B64`).
3. Push to `main` (or re-run the **Build & Deploy** workflow). The deploy job
   rewrites the VM's env files and restarts.

Adding a *new* var is the same flow — it's just part of the file. `entrypoint.sh`
validates required vars at container start and fails fast if one is missing, so a
bad/incomplete secret is caught immediately (the old container keeps running).

## Notes

- **Model/voice config** (`LANGUAGES`, `VOICE_LANGUAGES`) lives in `pocket-tts.env`.
  Changing it and redeploying triggers new downloads on next start (cached after);
  reclaim disk for removed ones with `make prune-models-apply`.
- **Secrets vs non-secrets:** bundling both files as base64 secrets is the pragmatic
  choice for a single VM. To review config in PRs instead, graduate to a
  SOPS/age-encrypted env committed to the repo and decrypted at deploy.
- **Rollback:** images are tagged by commit SHA (`ghcr.io/readium/speech-server:<sha>`);
  pin that tag in compose and redeploy to roll back the app. Config rolls back by
  restoring the previous secret value.
